                    Disclaimer: We start a series of stories describing various issues and problems
                    that are related for the most part to the Internet, and our vision of possible ways
                    to solve them. Those will often be followed by previews of projects mentioned in
                    the stories. Keep in mind: some of them might change, some will remain just our
                    fantasy; at this moment we are a small team, but with a great desire to change this
                    world for the better or at least a little bit.

                        Victor came home in an excellent mood – he scored another rarity for his collection
                        of the past. Gently taking a small slim and transparent plastic box with a logo
                        of a long gone company out of the package he curiously turned it over in his hands.
                        Full of excitement he opened it and took it to a brightly let window area to have
                        a better look at its contents. The disc had “CD-R 650 MB” written on it. He released
                        the disc from the case with a slight click. Victor turned it and saw barely visible
                        multi-color sun reflections across the room created by the mirror backside of the
                        disc.

                        to Victor’s discontent with such an arrogant handling of the rarity. He then brought
                        the disc closer to his eyes.

                        past, if they wrote all of their data on such large size media with such small capacity.
                        Just imagine what how many of these will be required to record at least one holographic
                        movie!

                        His brother chuckled, however didn’t start to lecture once again about the past
                        formats and how much space they took. Instead he sat at the table-screen, entered
                        a password on its surface and opened his private “in” page. Few would use such this
                        term, it was a unified entry point for everyone and as such it was meaningless to
                        anybody’s identify. It was generally called “network”. Victor did read that not
                        so long ago the network was divided into separate fragments called “web sites” and
                        one needed to know their addresses to access them. They could be found through special
                        services called search engines, a rather popular feature at that time. He even knew
                        the name of one of it but it was odd and always skipped his memory. At some time
                        later new projects appeared.

                        Their authors approached the problem from the other side and interchanged the core
                        of the things – now information was looking for the user not the other way around.
                        Victor was young and has just started to work in web development, he did however
                        has heard from his more experienced workmates that earlier instead of developing
                        logic and functionality of projects and filling them with data, people had to think
                        about such things like separate design and UI for each (!) site. He always felt
                        sorry for users who had to understand every time what and where was located and
                        at the same time they had to be content with what the owner of the resource felt
                        like adding. Or on another hand the user had to endure unnecessary elements of the
                        forced UI. At the same time developers had to face an insidious beast whose name
                        was cross-browser compatibility! Victor did not fully understand what the problem
                        was, but the expressions of those telling the story gave him an idea about the immensity
                        of the issue. Then phrases like “so that it would be displayed smoothly on the whole,
                        $#@!, zoo of devices!“ brought to his imagination terrible monsters that the web-developers
                        fought against like knights in glittering armor. Victor liked reading about knights.

                        While he did not know what “caching” meant he knew that in those days the connection
                        was slow and at the same time one had to download a lot of junk needed to correctly
                        display each separate web-site and besides much of that mess was duplicated many
                        times! However, he tried to be not naive and did not believe every single word he
                        was told: it often seemed to him that seniors simply pulled his leg and laughed
                        behind his back. He listened to the stories about attacks referred to with dreadful
                        words DDoS, or XSS, SQL with a lot of interest. For some reason he imagined virtual
                        ancient pirate like battles. It was probably because the word “pirates” was also
                        mentioned from time to time. But later he still had to ask more detailed questions
                        about the subject. And even if this was true many such attacks couldn’t happen today
                        as the system simply receives data textually (pure data) and sends is in a such
                        manner as well. So by default this data cannot harm neither client nor server. Furthermore,
                        this approach enables instant sending of small kilobyte pages since the client or
                        server receives only useful data without any HTML, JS and CSS junk.

                        He also knew that earlier web pages were detached from the global processing. This
                        task was to a very limited extent solved by the search engines he thought of earlier.
                        He imagined them as the giants with clay feet. Victor liked looking for colorful
                        analogies. Millions bowed down to them every day to get an answer regarding the
                        network location of the required information and pity on you if you don’t know how
                        to ask correctly! Also he heard some blood curdling stories about spam and non-relevant
                        ads all over the place. The rumor has it that it was practically on every site.
                        Victor found it rather useful that now the network offered custom ads at the appropriate
                        moment based on his preferences and requirements but he couldn’t understand what
                        good it was to show the same canned ads to everyone. Authors of articles, books,
                        music, and video, manufacturers of various products – all of them had to participate
                        in the insane rush for consumers. And then these consumers also had to look for
                        the necessary information and products. An incredible amount of money was spent
                        for ads and that increased the prices not to mention that these ads were almost
                        never objective and simply deceived consumers or at best emiftished the goods.

                        The story was that at that time the pieces of network called websites were not able
                        to distinguish users and knew nothing about their interests. Once again Victor felt
                        sorry for the users. He pictured them as unfortunate small creatures wandering in
                        a huge labyrinth, trying to force their way to the required information through
                        the wilderness of ads and spam that grew in abundance as enormous trees and tried
                        to catch users with their nasty branches. And even if someone managed to avoid them,
                        it was too early to rejoice: one had to mind further steps as not to be trapped
                        by fraudulent websites that were spread all over the network. The Trust Level concept
                        was not used at that time as a universal tool that got rid of fakes and spam once
                        and for all.

                        However social networks were the craftiest! Many users didn’t even suspect or simply
                        didn’t listen to people warning about the risk of providing personal data to such
                        resources. Victor just shook his head in amazement and disbelief when he heard stories
                        about such networks. Now every user had an individual reliable Vault-server that
                        securely safeguarded the owner’s data. The theft of personal data is severely punished
                        but to think that someone was to give it to others on their own?? No, apparently
                        these were just tall tales or at least greatly exaggerated stories like many other
                        things told him by his senior colleagues about the Internet past. The only thing
                        that he didn’t doubt was that all user data was saved not on Vault-servers but locally
                        or on discs like the one he held in this hands – a piece of the past sparkling in
                        the sun rays!
