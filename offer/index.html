The rating is, first of all, a value that reflects the level of popularity and trust, which has a direct impact on how fast new users can be attracted, and correspondingly determines the cost of the DAO’s tokens. Thus, the change of the rating between rounds is the key benchmark for calculating the next round factor.",
