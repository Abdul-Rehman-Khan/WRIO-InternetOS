        "WRIO Internet OS, or simply WRIO OS, is your window to the world of decentralized, semantic and secure Internet based on the blockchain technology, with the function of Intelligent Assistant. The name originates from the acronym of “webRunes Input/Output Internet Operating System”, and it intends to replace desktop OS’s in the future.",
        "At the dawn of the computer era, due to the stand-alone nature of computers there was a need in desktop operating systems. Now, at the Internet age, we have an opportunity to use network resources, which contributed to the rise of numerous cloud services such as Dropbox or Netflix. Web-technologies provide an opportunity to get rid of the necessity to install desktop applications, yet WRIO OS goes even further: by developing and uniting cloud services we arrive at the situation when we do not need the desktop OS at all. Access to the Internet allows to replace it with just a browser thus excluding the need in powerful processors and large memory size, and broadband access does the same for high capacity HDDs.",
        "There were many attempts to develop a web based OS. However, those were a copy of desktop OS, which resulted in the development of a system designed to perform cloud tasks through the desktop approach, and, consequently, such attempts failed.",
        "In order to understand why it happened, we will consider two cases: operation of a desktop OS and WRIO OS. Each modern device (computer, smartphone, tablet and etc.) has an operating system, such as Windows or Linux. All these OSs differ greatly but have the same weak points: they become morally obsolete, need to be updated, have their own sets of drivers, low or no compatibility with each other; certain technical knowledge is required to be able to install, setup or repair them; they are vulnerable to viruses, key loggers and other malware, and etc. The only their advantage is that they do not require Internet for operation, that is they are stand-alone. Yet, it is no secret that every day more and more people solve their professional and personal tasks just using a browser. Going on with using a desktop OS we add a set of Internet threats to the problems mentioned above: malware scripts, fraud and phishing, the risk of losing access to numerous accounts of various services due to the absence of transferability – we have to register in each and every new service over and over again. The problem was to a certain extent solved by logins through social media, but this leads to a greater risk – our private data no longer belong to us: social media sell them to third parties and transfer to government entities. Fortunately, day by day more and more people become concerned and begin to understand that the loss of control over personal data will lead to the loss of freedom.",
        "WRIO Internet OS deals with the mentioned problems, and in subsequent chapters we will consistently describe the solution of each of them. For now it shall be noted that desktop OSs may and shall be replaced with web-OSs resulting in the creation of simple, and hence more reliable, cost-cutting and affordable devices with a minimalistic and lightweight operational system being merely a browser. Such systems will weigh just dozens of megabytes, i.e. hundreds or thousands of times less than today’s desktop monsters. Instant boot, minimal or no need in updates aside from pure browser updates, reliability and maximum protection due to the ability to load in a virtual container will be key features of such systems.",
        "WRIO OS is an easy to use shell organized as a set of web-applications functioning as desktop programs. The user’s ability to pick up a completely customized set of web-applications will result in the change of the Internet paradigm and birth of a user-centered web. A system of such kind will always stay up-to-date and will not require any technical expertise to install or setup, while access to the personal cloud from any device using a multi-factor authentication will solve the problem of personal data loss or theft.",
        "User data protection is one of the key priorities of WRIO OS: the universal use of cryptography and encryption along with the provision of anonymity will ensure maximum security. And the symbiosis with various anonymous networks will enable the use of advanced technologies without the need to understand them.",
        "WRIO OS is an isomorphic JavaScript application. These are advanced systems that work equally well both on a client and a server. Such adaptive applications can actualize various levels of client-server processing depending on the channel width and client capacities. In our case we go beyond the approach described in the link above. There is no need to divide transferred data into data for users and search bots.",
        "WRIO OS is not just a cloud OS. It creates a peer-to-peer distributed system and utilizes computing power of all consolidated computers, providing user only with the results of data processing and computations.",
        "It shall be noted that despite of the fact that the system requires an access to the Internet to ensure its fully-featured operation, WRIO OS can be also used offline to a limited extent: reading of earlier downloaded news, viewing of video clips, listening to music, management of documents with subsequent synchronization online, and some other functions. With each passing day Internet infrastructure’s cost goes down while its quality goes up, thus the problem with access to the Internet is diminished.",
        "Not only WRIO OS paves a way into the future where any device will have just a browser installed, but also, which is more important, it will change the Internet and will bring it to a brand new level that some call web 3.0 or semantic web. Instead of today's obsolete sites we work with pure semantic data and personalized recommendation system, and blockchain performs the function of a generally available and uncensored global catalogue. Web 3.0 will lead to the Internet-of-Things.",
        "The WRIO OS’s support of third-party sites 2.0 will help to ensure a phased transition to the new level, and the semantic web revolution will pass unnoticed by the majority of users as a smooth evolution."

        "Nowadays Internet is marked by a number of drawbacks. The most significant of them is its centralized nature, which makes the Internet exposed to restrictions and censorship on the part of corporations and governments. The mixing of data and representation results in technical flaws. Apart from the data you may need, every web-page contains an “envelope” – the rules that a browser uses to interpret how the page shall be displayed. As the Internet developed, such envelopes became so heavy that useful data sometimes accounts for only 5-10% of a page size. At first glance this may seem unimportant, though the page size not only influences the cost of Internet-services (which may be essential in case of mobile Internet), but also has a direct effect on the download speed, and therefore your latency time. The mixing of data and representation makes computer parsing significantly more complex and hinders the sorting and cataloging of information by search engines, which undermines the accuracy and relevancy of their responses to your search queries. Unfortunately, Internet pages look like a mish-mash, from which it is difficult for search engines to withdraw data. The result is that the Internet lacks what it was originally planned for by the web inventor Tim Berners-Lee – semantics.",
        "WRIO OS is meant to rectify the above mentioned flaws and is committed to achieve the following goals:",
        "* the Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries. The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data that can be processed by machines (Wikipedia). Such a Web will allow users to find the appropriate information with ease and accuracy unavailable nowadays. Semantics leads to another important feature – openness",
        "* the openness enables an unrestricted reading of data stored on third-party servers. It means the use of data from the original sources without a need in multiple duplication and loss of consistency. Today data are secured. That is if you want to use them on your own page, you either need to copy them, or obtain them through API, which is often means technical or financial restrictions. Besides, there might be problems with the hated-by-all-free-Internet copyright, which will be discussed separately in the Open Copyright section",
        "* decentralization. In its turn the web openness allows to create a decentralized Internet, which will not only provide a free access to information, but will also terminate corporations’ and social media’s control over public user data. If you consider that being a phony issue and cling to the notion that you are of no importance, then read “Alternative: I Have Nothing to Hide” section of the book",
        "* the decentralization also means the immunity to persistent control and censorship attempts on the part of the government, as well as mass surveillance",
        "* security. Every time you visit an unfamiliar website you take the risk of running into spam, viruses, malware, and other Internet threats. This is all because the code embedded into web-pages, apart from adding interactivity and functionality, may pose a threat, download and run abusers’ programs. Security issues and how WRIO OS can help to deal with them will be discussed in a separate chapter",
        "These are not all the drawbacks of the nowadays Internet that we described. More of them are consistently discussed in the following chapters. For now it is just worthwhile to note that solving any of the problems opens new opportunities for us as users. And every chapter read will provide new details on how young the Internet still is, that we are yet at the beginning of its development, and the  potential of this great invention is far from being fully unleashed. The book describes a number of different wondrous technologies that will help to bring the web to a whole new level; it will show what can become of it, what is required, what effect it will have, and how it will eventually change each of us, the society and the world in general."

        "WRIO Internet OS will become a personalized access point to free and safe semantic web for everyone. The “Internet” prefix means that instead of traditional desktop applications the OS uses online services installed at remote servers. This approach is known as “cloud computing”. In real life it means that the only thing you  need for the system to work is a device (any device, from a mobile phone to a games console) with a browser and Internet access, which is reflected in the project motto “All you need is a browser”.",
        "The system is well suited both for desktop and mobile users. In some countries the number of mobile users has already exceeded the number of traditional users that go online through desktop computers. For instance, in China that happened in 2013. Even today many people do not need a desktop OS. The only thing they need is an access to the Internet, and WRIO OS platform can provide functionality that allows it to replace desktop OSs. The basic functionality does not require installation, setup or technical expertise, and automatic updates will ensure the system always remains up-to-date. Details on how everything works can be found in section “WRIO OS Structure”.",
        "Todays’ Internet consists of millions of websites unrelated to one another, many of which require registration and login, and outside the site the use of information is either encumbered or impossible at all. The Internet can be represented as a bag with boxes of candies inside. Each box is a web-site, and candies are its pages. To obtain information you first need to “bring each box to your desk” (download), and then open it and “try” each candy one after another (view). The procedure must be repeated for another web-site. Apart from that, there is another major problem: you do not know what the candy will taste like until you try it – you can only guess it from your previous experience of trying “candies” from that web-site.",
        "The thing with WRIO platform is that it creates pure data (“candies without a box”) arranged by color, taste, brand, ingredients and other parameters that a computer can “understand” and thus process them automatically. This will enable the development of a personified and accurate recommender system. And even though a computer does not know what taste is, the semantic provides a set of labels for each “candy” (page) that the computer does “understand”.  While processing such information, our system can offer it to those users whose taste matches that information, and the more “candies” a user consumes the more accurate our next recommendation will be. Besides, transfer of open data (“without boxes”) significantly speeds up its download.",
        "Open data also enable everyone interested to easily process and use them, or create various services on their basis: automatically select materials on a subject, create knowledge bases and recommender systems, and etc. At the same time personal data of a user remain safe, encrypted, and cannot be used by third parties (see section Encryption for details), which is in stark contrast to the practice of existing services and social media, where data are consistently sold to corporations, disclosed to governmental authorities, or simply stolen by abusers. However, if you want to process data, it will be possible only if the service has an API, and to connect to it one needs to study specifications and embed it into the project’s code. Within our approach we do not operate with detached websites, rather focus on using decentralized data that are all the same unified in a single semantic network.",
        "As you might have noticed, the semantic web design pretty much looks like a neural network.  This comparison has its grounds and runs through the entire project structure like a golden thread: data act as neurons, and the distance describes the strength of interconnections, which eventually creates a semantic matrix that enables the system to “think”. And this forms the basis of IA. This leads us to another feature – a shift from the traditional representation of the Internet as a variety of unrelated web-sites to a scale-free network of distributed yet semantically interrelated atomic data. Atomic data represent all the information about an integral and indivisible entity: a person, an organization, a book, a movie, a song and etc. Such a system provides new possibilities. One of them is that it is able to create an Internet that will be resistant to censorship and governmental control, and where every user that opens a page can automatically become a node and distribute to others. This is the way BitTorrent works that many got accustomed to. Systems of that kind cannot be gated off by provider blocking the domain or adding the URL/IP to a block-list.",
        "In view of wretched recent events related to NSA and other security services, information revealed by Edward Snowden, as well as laws under elaboration, like PIPA, or SOPA, the need for preserving anonymity and protecting users from felonious governmental wiretapping and surveillance becomes more and more evident.",
        "The creation of an uncontrollable Internet is an indispensable step for the making of an independent and free society. And such a possibility is offered by unrivalled technology – blockchain. Eventually, there will appear a blockchain browser that will change the very essence of network browsing. People will be able to gain access to information saved on millions of computers scattered across every corner of our planet. And in conjunction with Taglang and the recommender system users will get a service that far outreaches a simple search.",
        "Information retrieval requires effort and time. The good news is that many people look beyond social media (their threats and downsides will be discussed in a separate section), and search long and hard for the sources that most accurately correspond to their private interests. Yet, why not do it automatically? Stream is the system designed to do it. The content is arranged and catalogued according to your own criteria, and is represented as data flows. The number of web-sites is constantly increasing, and the stream of information has long exceeded our physical abilities to consume it. People urgently need a system that will take on the task of automatic cataloging endlessly growing information avalanche.",
        "Finances is another domain every one of us considers important. Crowdfunding and donations have proven their efficiency already. Quite a many of various projects have been developed with the support of millions of people. Open Copyright and micropayments will enable the support of favorite authors, while books, songs, movies, games and dozens of other projects created by them will pave the golden age of the independent culture to the exclusion of corporations based on the copyright. But soon, many will stop considering money as a measure of success: for them goodwill is the currency of the future.",
        "In order for peer-to-peer networks to develop, parties need to trust each other, and goodwill becomes the most important criterion for making transactions. Rating systems of trading platforms like eBay have already proven their efficiency with no need for the use of government entities, passports and other anachronisms. Global decentralized system Web of Trust provides conditions to close deals with participants you’ve never met.",
        "It shall be noted that the idea of a web OS is not unique: there were other attempts to develop a cloud / Internet OS. However, all of them mirrored the functionality and interface of a desktop OS, which, in our opinion, was their principal error. The Web requires a different approach. Today the closest analogue solution is Chrome OS by  Google. The principal difference of WRIO OS is that it is not just a cloud OS with a set of applications performing tasks peculiar to desktop operation systems like Windows or Mac OS, rather a kind of add-on to the Internet that is something more than separate services and web-sites. The system combines them, creating a mashup. For instance, after adding a post, the author can enable comments (Titter, through Twitter), receive donations (webGold, on the basis of Ethereum), share it with friends (Share, through various services and social media) and etc.",
        "The mashup is a bridge that links the Internet of today with its new version. With the help of aps developed on the basis of third-party service APIs like payment platforms, social media and etc., we integrate traditional stand-alone functions into a single whole. When connecting Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, YouTube, Dropbox, Steam, and etc., users expand their version of WRIO OS till they have all the functions they need: mail, communication, video, data storage, online shopping, games, education and so on, turning their computer or smartphone into an indispensable assistant for all spheres of life. The direction of data flow changes: instead of users visiting detached resources, now information flows from sites to users, and we’ll become the first to enjoy the egocentric web.",
        "All WRIO OS aps work as components of an integral system within a modular approach. Besides, anyone can develop their own services for WRIO platform and sell them, just like Google Play works. However, our project has a key distinction: its code is open, which gives a possibility to launch your own independent node. The use of open source goes beyond usual reasons: we view Internet as an instrument capable of uniting people into a self-regulated society, and open-source software is its natural component.",
        "Internet has long become ingrained in our everyday life, and as we go forward it will have increasingly greater influence on us. What we need is a system that will be a guide and a guard in the realm of Internet. The question is not whether it will appear, the question is who will be the first to implement the idea up-to-the-mark. Today, cloud platforms are being developed by Google and Mozilla Foundation (Chrome OS and Firefox OS), though their objectives differ essentially from the objectives of WRIO OS. The launch of WRIO OS browser turns devices with just a browser onboard into inexpensive yet powerful tools, which, if lost, can be quickly replaced, since all the data are encrypted and stored on millions of computers in a distributed manner, and can be easily accessed from a new device.",
        "As a result, all the above mentioned goals represent our vision of semantic web or, as some call it, “Web 3.0”. If successful, the Internet will transform from a clumsy heap of isolated web-sites into a free distributed base of semantic data available to everyone, where the required information can be found in a quick and easy way. Besides, Web 3.0 is required for the implementation of our primary project — Alternative.",
        "The age of web-OSs is nigh! In time, advantages of such an OS will increasingly outweigh benefits of  desktop systems, until the latter pass into oblivion for the majority of users. This is confirmed by services popping up like mushrooms after a summer rain that substitute desktop applications: for many people Google Docs took the place of MS Office, Dropbox substituted local data storages, Netflix – home collections of movies, and etc. Thus, systems like WRIO OS fitted with a set of applications for all intents and purposes will be more than just a window into the Internet: they will become an indispensable assistant for every user during all stages of their lives and in all aspects – collection, storage and classification of information, protection of personal data, social activity, work, accounting and etc.",
        "In the near future there will be no need in visiting web-sites personally: smart systems will automatically retrieve and analyze information on the basis of users’ interests, and will deliver it at proper time. Using Internet through a WRIO OS node one can get much more than visiting separate services in the old-fashioned way. The time of “The Wild Wild Internet” goes by, social media and search engines will become history, and bitter fight for the position of the automatic assistant as an interface between the user and the flow of data is yet to come. The one becoming a better personal secretary, capable of providing personalized services, collecting, filtering and classifying the increasing flow of information, and as a result capable of producing accurate recommendations, as if the user had done everything independently – that one will evolve and will survive on the increasingly tight market of Internet-services."

        "This section describes general operating principles and application scenarios only. Technical details will be discussed in “WRIO OS Architecture” section. WRIO OS application scenarios form a long list. So, to gain a detailed insight into each of them we singled them out into separate chapters. For now, we shall consider standard user interaction with todays web-sites to make a comparison afterwards.",
        "Alice wishes to find certain information. First, she needs to go through search results hoping the search engine did its work well and the required page will be among the top hits. In order to understand whether a page is the one she needs, Alice has to open it and at least cast a glance upon its content. Now let’s get a little bit more technical. When opening a web-site, prior to displaying data a browser downloads the so called site envelope that is a mix of HTML markup, JavaScript, CSS, fonts, icons and graphic elements. All these are required for the browser to “construct” a page. The size of these files may vary, but usually it’s from 0.5 to 2 MB, so if your Internet is good the loading will take just a couple of seconds.",
        "As an example we used a blank article without pictures. Wikipedia is a fast and popular web-site of good quality that suits well for an example. As you see, the lion’s share of the page is taken by UI, CSS and JavaScript graphical elements. HTML accounts for about 20%, but the least of useful information is related to HTML. Pure text takes just 20kb, the rest is HTML formatting that determines the page structure. In other words, just 4% of 500kb are useful data. Although your browser will have to download less data when opening another page, since much will be taken from the cache, even in this case useful data will account for just 14%. Certainly, these are not absolute values: on some sites the ratio will be better, but in general these figures will be worse. The problem is not with Wikipedia, the problem is with todays’ web-sites.",
        "But, let’s go back to Alice. She has already found the required page, and after a click the request was sent to the server through the Internet provider, and then the response made a back trip. So far it’s simple. It shall be noted though that in most cases data are taken from a data base, which is just another point of potential site failure. Besides, Alice often has to disclose her personal data to obtain required information.",
        "And she has to avoid multiple perils: fishing, personal data theft, viruses and etc. Unfortunately, no antivirus can guarantee safe web-surfing. The problem is that when a site is loaded, auxiliary files can impose security risks and execute malicious code. She also needs to remember passwords to multiple accounts, though in real life users prefer convenience to security and use the same simple passwords for all services, which often leads to mass theft of accounts. Although logging in through social media accounts has significantly facilitated access to services, the problem is still there. Moreover, we can increasingly often hear about breaks-in of popular service servers, when fraudsters get access to personal data of millions of users.",
        "But Alice’s problems are far from being over: even greater devil may be the one whom she pays for the service – the Internet provider and the State. In the following example Alice gets an error message when trying to open website 3. There is no connection. The reasons may be many, but we shall consider blocking: IP address and/or the domain were entered into the provider’s block list for whatever cause (usually, a political), or the access is blocked using DPI.  And though it is often possible to bypass the block with the help of a proxy-server or VPN, this requires certain knowledge that Alice – a common user – lacks.",
        "Fortunately, not all countries resort to censorship and blocking. But a growing number of them forge various anti-social laws like PIPA and SOPA to secure their political goals and to protect big business, though they cover it with various plausible causes.",
        "Be as it may, the result is the same: the freedom of speech in the Internet becomes an illusion, while governmental control, supervision and censorship gain momentum. The State will continue to solve its problems by cutting freedoms of citizens, until we become a strategic stockpile.",
