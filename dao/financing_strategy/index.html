Each of them automatically pays out 1% of all their earnings under Open Copyright terms and conditions. As DAOs and applications develop, and as their number grows, so rise the earnings.",

As a reward for their efforts and the assistance in bringing in more readers such users receive 25% of all donations made with respect to such content. The author receives an invitation on behalf of the topic-starter or one of the grateful readers, and if the invitation is accepted the author joins the project and receives the transferred donations",
        "2. comments through Titter. Every time when leaving a comment a user can make donations using webGold, and his/her tweet with the comment, donated amount and link to the post will be displayed to his/her subscribers. Thus the author can obtain new readers, and WRIO OS — new users",
